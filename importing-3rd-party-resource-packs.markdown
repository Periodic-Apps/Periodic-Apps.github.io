# Resourceful: Importing 3rd party resource packs

Resourceful officially supports importing only resource packs that it originally exported. The reasons for this are a bit complex but the tl;dr is that your mileage may vary when attempting import 3rd party resource packs. We hope to add official support for this in the future.

To import a Minecraft resource pack (i.e. a file ending with .mcpack), navigate to the project list view and tap the import button (the arrow pointing into a box) in the top right corner of the tap.
