# Resourceful: How to Load the Minecraft Vanilla Resource Pack

Mojang provides a template Vanilla Resource Pack (also known as Bedrock Samples) that contains all of the default block definitions and their textures. While it is possible to use Resourceful without this pack (by [importing 3rd party resource packs](/importing-3rd-party-resource-packs), **we strongly recommend that you download and import Mojang’s Vanilla Resource Pack** to provide a good starting point for new projects.

From your mobile web browser, download the **[Minecraft vanilla resource pack](https://github.com/Mojang/bedrock-samples/archive/refs/tags/v1.21.110.2.zip)**.

Using mobile Safari, the file will be stored in the **Downloads** section of the **Files app** on your iPhone or iPad. The download location may vary if you’re using another mobile browser.

Return to **Resourceful app**.

From the Project list view, **tap the ellipsis button** in the top right corner, then **tap Import (.mcpack)**.

Navigate using the Files interface to the location of the downloaded file. This is typically **iCloud Drive -> Downloads**.

Select the file named **bedrock-samples-1.2X.XX.X.zip**. The resource pack will be imported and available to copy blocks from as needed.
