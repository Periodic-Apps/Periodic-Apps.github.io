What if you could change the way Minecraft looks in less than a minute? We wondered the same thing and built Resourceful to make it a reality.

# Create, Test, Share in under a minute. Really.

## Create

Resourceful makes it easy and fun to modify how most blocks look in Minecraft. You don’t need to be a computer wiz or understand the intricacies of Minecraft’s modding APIs.

No more messing around with zip files, strange file formats, or Photoshop. With Resourceful, you can start creating your own texture packs in minutes!

Modify or completely replace the vanilla textures using the built-in brushes such as Color, Tint, or Randomize, or create your own brushes in the Brush Editor.

## Test

Once you’ve created your masterpiece, you can test it in Minecraft in a few simple steps.

Changing the way Minecraft looks has never be so easy.

## Share

Send your Resourceful projects to your friends as standard Minecraft resource packs. They can open them in Minecraft or open them in Resourceful to make their own changes.
